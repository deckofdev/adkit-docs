4.	If current scene contains event manager, then an action will pop up asking to delete existing events from scene or leave them.
  1.	Yes, delete – deletes old events from the scene.
  1.	No, leave – leaves old events in the scene.
  3.	Cancel, revert data – resets to previous selected data.

?> **Quick Tip:**  
•	If the selected data has been used in the scene or old data events will be useful in the future, then it is recommended to leave old events.

5.	If the new data file will contain network SDK(s) which are not installed in the current project, then error will pop up explaining which network SDK(s) are not installed. There are two actions that can be made:
  1.	Install/Enable Missing SDK(s) – opens SDK menu to install and enable all missing SDK(s). After installing all missing SDK(s) error will disappear.
  2.	Discard Missing Ad Networks from Mediation – manager will delete all networks, that are missing in the project, from each profile mediation
