2. Here you will find all the settings that can be changed in the manager:
  1. Set Theme Automatically – sets manager theme according to Unity Editor theme. If disabled, user can select whether display dark or light theme manually.
  2. Debug Mode – all messages related to AdKit plugin will be displayed in console. Including when ads were requested, ready, shown, closed etc.
  3. Display Warnings – if enabled, then warnings will be displayed in manager window whenever user set values might not work as intended. This also prevents accidentally deleting ad profiles.
  4. Fixed Percent – ad profiles percent mediation sum will always be set to 100%.
  5. Show All ID’s – if enabled, then both Android and iOS SDK id’s will be displayed.
  6. Lock on Playmode – when Unity Editor is in playmode then AdKit manager will be locked and no changes can be done. If disabled, then user will be able to change manager data. (Proceed with caution because this function is not fully tested).
  7. Auto Check for Updates – plugin will occasionally check for active network and plugin updates.
