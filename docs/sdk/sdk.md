# SDK

**SDK** – using the plugin developers will be able to download, install and setup different network SDKs in one place. Developers will have an ability to choose between recommended and newest network SDKs. Intelligent editor will provide useful information on how to setup networks and notify if there is a new update for the network.

In this section we are going to explain how to install and setup ad networks for AdKit plugin. Each network has its own section where all changes can be done. Some networks require External Dependency Manager which also will be provided.

1. Open AdKit manager and select “SDK” tab.
