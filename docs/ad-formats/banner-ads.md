# Banner Ads ‎

Banner ads are rectangular image or text ads that occupy a spot-on screen. They stay on screen while users are interacting with the app.

In this section we will explain how to create and manage banner ad profiles in the AdKit manager. Also, we will provide list of functions and code snippets, alongside with example project code. 
 

!> **Prerequisites:**  
•	Installed and enabled one or more ad networks, which support banner ads.

## Settings

In this section we will explain banner settings which will apply for all banner profiles.

1.	In the AdKit manager select “Banner Ads” field and enable it.

![Banner Ads Section](../images/banner/1.png ":size=400 :class=center")

2.	If the project has no ad network which support banner ads, then the message with warning about missing ad networks. To access banner ads, project must have at least one ad network, which support banner ads, enabled.
 
![Enabled Banner Ads With No Network Available](../images/banner/2.png ":size=400 :class=center")

3.	After enabling banner ads all functions will become available and banner ads will be ready to be shown on the app.
 
  ![Enabled Banner Ads With Available Network](../images/banner/3.png ":size=400 :class=center")

  1.	After Ad Was Opened – following actions can be done after banner ad has been opened.
        1.	Nothing – nothing will happen, banner ad will still be shown.
        2.	Hide – banner ad will be hidden.
        3.	Destroy Network – active banner ad network will be destroyed.
        4.	Request Next – following banner ad network will be requested according to selected mediation type.
        5.	Show Next - following banner ad network will be requested according to selected mediation type and after request finished, the banner ad will be shown.

?> **Quick Tip:**  
•	Unity Ads does not support on banner open event. Therefore, After Ad Was Opened functions will not work for this network.

![After Ad Was Opened Functions](../images/banner/4.png ":size=200 :class=center")

  2.	Request Timer – Request will be considered as failed if it will not be finished after the specified period.
    1.	Wait for Request - how long to wait for request to finish before canceling request (Seconds).

![Request Timer](../images/banner/5.png ":size=400 :class=center")

  3.	Request Next Ad If Failed – if banner ad fails to load then following banner ad network will be requested according to selected mediation type.

## Profile

**Ad Profiles** – using AdKit developers can create individual ad profiles for different use cases and launch them into the project. Each ad profile has integrated useful functions including ad breaks, mediation, events, etc.

In this section we will explain how to create and setup new banner profile.

1.	Select “New Banner Profile” button to create new banner profile.
 
![New Banner Profile](../images/banner/7.png ":size=400 :class=center")

2.	Section with new banner profile will appear.

  1.	Banner profile name.
  2.	Copy banner profile name.
  3.	Duplicate banner profile.
  4.	Minimize banner profile.
  5.	Delete banner profile.

![Banner Profile](../images/banner/8.png ":size=400 :class=center")

## Profile ID 

Used when calling specific ad profile.

##	Show at Initialize

 Display banner when AdKit is initialized.

```csharp
//(AdKitBanner) Returns banner that has been created when plugin initialized.
AdKitGeneral.GetShowAtInitializeBanner();
```
  
##	 Banner Place 

Includes 7 different places where banner ad can be displayed on the screen.

?> **Quick Tip:**  
•	Facebook and IronSource only supports top and bottom positions. Therefore, banner will be displayed according to selected banner place:   
‎ ‎ ‎o	(Top Left/Middle/Right) -> Top.  
‎ ‎ ‎o	(Center, Bottom Left/Middle/Right) -> Bottom.

![Banner Place](../images/banner/9.png ":size=150 :class=center")

##	Banner Size

Includes 2 sizes to choose between.
  
?> **Quick Tip:**  
•	Unity Ads and AdColony does not support large banner size. Therefore, plugin will automatically display standard banner size for both networks. 

![Banner Size](../images/banner/10.png ":size=150 :class=center")

##	Ad Break 

Banner requests will be disabled for a custom amount of time, requests or until the exit of the game.
  
![Ad Break](../images/banner/11.png ":size=400 :class=center") 
  
1.	Ad Break Type – ad break can last for a custom time/request amount or until player exits app. 

![Ad Break Type](../images/banner/12.png ":size=150 :class=center")

2.	Time/Request Break – how long (minutes/requests) banner request will be disabled.
3.	End Break on Exit – Ad break will end when player exits app. If disabled, ad break will be active after restarting app. 

##	Banner Mediation 

**Mediation** – in each ad profile developers will have a chance to swap between different mediation types. Developers can create their own ad network order in which the ads will be shown or select to display ad networks by percentage or randomly.

In what order banner ad networks will be requested.
  
![Banner Mediation](../images/banner/13.png ":size=150 :class=center")

1.	Order – manually selected order in which banner networks will be requested.

![Order Mediation](../images/banner/14.png ":size=400 :class=center")

2.	Percent – banner networks will be requested according to the percentages indicated for each network. The higher the percentage, the higher number of ads will be requested from the network.

  ![Percent Mediation](../images/banner/15.png ":size=400 :class=center")

  1.	Has Request Limit – Same network can be requested only for custom amount of times. After the limit is reached, new network from the list will be requested.
        1.	Network Show Limit – How many times same network ad can be shown.

  ![Request Limit](../images/banner/16.png ":size=400 :class=center")

3.	Random – plugin randomly selects ad network.

  ![Random Mediation](../images/banner/17.png ":size=400 :class=center")

  1.	Has Request Limit – Same network can be requested only for custom amount of times. After the limit is reached, new network from the list will be requested.
        1.	Network Show Limit – How many times same network ad can be shown.
